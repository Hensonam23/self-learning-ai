DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - Research Note

DHCP automatically assigns IP configuration to devices on a network. This includes IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.

The DHCP process is known as DORA:
- Discover
- Offer
- Request
- Acknowledge

DHCP uses UDP ports 67 (server) and 68 (client).

DHCP leases are time limited and must be renewed. Reservations allow a device to always receive the same IP based on its MAC address.

DHCP relay allows DHCP traffic to cross routers between subnets.
