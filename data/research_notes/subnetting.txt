Subnetting - Research Note

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller networks called subnets. The main reasons are to control traffic, improve organization, reduce broadcast traffic, and use IP addresses more efficiently.

An IPv4 address has 32 bits. A subnet mask or prefix length like /24 tells how many bits belong to the network portion and how many belong to the host portion.

Key concepts:
- Network address: first address in the subnet, host bits all 0
- Broadcast address: last address in the subnet, host bits all 1
- Usable host range: addresses between network and broadcast
- Number of hosts: 2^(host bits) minus 2

Example: 192.168.10.0/24
- Network: 192.168.10.0
- Broadcast: 192.168.10.255
- Usable: 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.254
- Hosts: 254

Borrowing bits from the host portion creates more subnets with fewer hosts per subnet. Subnetting is used for VLANs, routing, and network segmentation.
