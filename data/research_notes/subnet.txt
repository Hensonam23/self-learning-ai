subnet (synthesized)

Definition:
- A subnet , or subnetwork , is a logical subdivision of an IP network . &#91; 1 &#93; &#58;&#8202;1,&#8202;16&#8202; The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting .
- Traffic is exchanged between subnets through routers when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.
- In IPv6 this is the only standards-based form to denote network or routing prefixes.

How it works:
- Break it into the main components or layers.
- For each component, say what it is responsible for, and what it is not responsible for.
- When troubleshooting, map the symptom to the layer or component that most likely owns it.

Examples:
- Write one simple example first, then one realistic example you might see at work.
- If it is a model or standard, explain what changes when you move between layers or parts.

Common mistakes:
- Mixing up similar sounding terms.
- Memorizing lists without understanding what actually changes in real systems.
- Using the wrong layer or component when troubleshooting.
