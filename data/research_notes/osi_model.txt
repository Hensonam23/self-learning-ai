osi model (synthesized)

Definition:
- The data to be transmitted is composed at the topmost layer of the transmitting device (layer N ) into a protocol data unit ( PDU ).
- The PDU is passed to layer N−1 , where it is known as the service data unit ( SDU ).
- At layer N−1 the SDU is concatenated with a header, a footer, or both, producing a layer N−1 PDU . It is then passed to layer N−2 .

How it works:
- Break it into the main components or layers.
- For each component, say what it is responsible for, and what it is not responsible for.
- When troubleshooting, map the symptom to the layer or component that most likely owns it.

Examples:
- Write one simple example first, then one realistic example you might see at work.
- If it is a model or standard, explain what changes when you move between layers or parts.

Common mistakes:
- Mixing up similar sounding terms.
- Memorizing lists without understanding what actually changes in real systems.
- Using the wrong layer or component when troubleshooting.
