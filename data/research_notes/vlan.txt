VLAN (Virtual LAN) - Research Note

A VLAN allows a single physical switch to be divided into multiple logical networks. Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate without routing.

Port types:
- Access ports carry one VLAN
- Trunk ports carry multiple VLANs using tagging

802.1Q tagging identifies VLAN traffic on trunk links.

Each VLAN typically maps to its own IP subnet. Inter-VLAN communication requires a router or Layer 3 switch.
