DNS (Domain Name System) - Research Note

DNS translates human friendly domain names like google.com into IP addresses. It allows users to access resources without remembering numeric IP addresses.

Basic DNS lookup process:
1) Client asks a DNS server for a record
2) Server responds from cache or performs recursion
3) Result is returned and cached for a time

Common DNS record types:
- A: domain to IPv4 address
- AAAA: domain to IPv6 address
- CNAME: alias to another domain
- MX: mail server records
- TXT: text records for verification

DNS typically uses UDP port 53. TCP port 53 is used for large responses and zone transfers.

DNS issues often appear as internet outages even when IP connectivity is working.
