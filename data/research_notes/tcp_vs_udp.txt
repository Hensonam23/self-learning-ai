TCP vs UDP - Research Note

TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols used to deliver data between applications.

TCP:
- Connection oriented
- Reliable and ordered delivery
- Uses acknowledgements and retransmissions
- Used for web, email, file transfer

UDP:
- Connectionless
- No delivery guarantees
- Lower overhead and faster
- Used for DNS, streaming, VoIP, gaming

TCP prioritizes reliability. UDP prioritizes speed and simplicity.
