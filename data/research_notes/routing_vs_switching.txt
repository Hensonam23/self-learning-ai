Routing vs Switching - Research Note

Switching operates at Layer 2 using MAC addresses. Switches forward traffic within the same local network.

Routing operates at Layer 3 using IP addresses. Routers move traffic between different networks and subnets.

Switches handle LAN traffic. Routers connect networks together and break broadcast domains.
