Firewall Basics - Research Note

A firewall controls network traffic using rules based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and direction.

Stateful firewalls track active connections and automatically allow return traffic.

Stateless firewalls evaluate each packet independently without tracking connections.

Firewalls commonly use a default deny approach and are placed at network boundaries to improve security.
