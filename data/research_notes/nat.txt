NAT (Network Address Translation) - Research Note

NAT translates private internal IP addresses to public IP addresses. It allows many devices to share a small number of public IPs.

Common private IPv4 ranges:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Types of NAT:
- PAT (Port Address Translation): many devices share one public IP
- Static NAT: one internal IP maps to one public IP
- Dynamic NAT: internal IPs map to a pool of public IPs

NAT is stateful and keeps a translation table to track connections.
