    "answer": "SUBNET\n\nDefinition:\n- What Is Subnetting and Subnet Mask?\n\nKey points:\n- Subnetting and subnet masks are fundamental concepts in network administration that often seem complex to beginners but become invaluable once mastered.\n- They allow network administrators to divide large IP address spaces into smaller, manageable segments while optimizing bandwidth usage and improving security.\n- Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets).\n- This division allows network administrators to create logical segments within their infrastructure, improving organization, security, and resource allocation.\n- Think of subnetting like dividing a large city into districts.\n- Each district has its own services, governance, and communication patterns, but all districts remain part of the larger city.\n\nExamples:\n- Example: 192.168.x.x/24 has 256 total addresses (0-255), with usable hosts typically .1 to .254 (depends on context).\n- Example: /26 splits a /24 into 4 subnets (each block size 64).\n\nCommon mistakes:\n- Mistake: confusing the subnet mask with the network address.\n- Mistake: forgetting that network + broadcast addresses are usually not usable host addresses in IPv4.\n\nPractice recognition:\n- Quick check: /24 = 255.255.255.0, /16 = 255.255.0.0, /8 = 255.0.0.0.\n- Quick check: block size = 256 - last mask octet (when the split is in the last octet).\n- Quick check: usable hosts in subnet = 2^(host bits) - 2 (typical IPv4).\n\nSources:\n- Direct URL: https://www.networkkings.org/what-is-subnetting",
